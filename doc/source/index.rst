Welcome to IR-SIM's documentation!
==================================

**IR-SIM** is an open-source, lightweight robot simulator based on Python, designed for robotics navigation, control, and learning. This simulator provides a simple, user-friendly framework for simulating robots, sensors, and environments, facilitating the development and testing of robotics algorithms with minimal hardware requirements. 

**Features**

- Simulate a wide range of robot platforms with diverse kinematics, sensors, and behaviors. 
- Quickly configure and customize simulation scenarios using straightforward YAML files, with no complex coding required.
- Visualize simulation outcomes in real time for immediate feedback and analysis using a naive visualizer matplotlib.
- Support collision detection and behavior control for each object in the simulation.
The simple demonstrations of the simulator are shown below:
