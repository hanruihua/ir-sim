## 2.7.3

- Fix keyboard bug in macOS
- Change the default keyboard backend to `pynput` (global keyboard hook). Falls back to Matplotlib (`mpl`) when `pynput` is unavailable.

- Docs:
  - Clarify sensor update order (objects step first, then sensors) and how to manually step sensors when controlling objects directly.


## 2.7.2

- Features:
  - Add a new gui section to the YAML configuration for keyboard and mouse controls. see [gui configuration](https://ir-sim.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yaml_config/configuration.html#gui-configuration) 
  
  - Change the default keyboard backend to Matplotlib (`mpl`), which uses figure window key events. The `mpl` backend is active when the Matplotlib figure window is focused. The `pynput` backend, which provides a global keyboard hook, remains supported and can be selected in YAML.
  
  - Add `env.reload()` to reload the environment on the fly, enabling YAML changes to be applied without closing the Matplotlib figure window.
  
  - Add hotkeys to configure and update environment settings, available in both `auto` and `keyboard` control modes:
    - `r`: Reset the environment
    - `space`: Pause/Resume the environment
    - `esc`: Quit the environment
    - `x`: Switch between keyboard and auto control modes
    - `l`: Reload the environment and apply the updated YAML without closing the Matplotlib figure window
  
  - update corresponding documentation and usage.

## 2.7.1

- Features:
  - Add `name` attribute for the object. It can be configured in the yaml file. The duplicate name check is added to ensure there are no duplicate names.
  - Clearify the `env.step` action order: 1st. keyboard control; 2nd. input action; 3rd. behavior control.
  - Add `env.get_object_by_name` and `env.get_object_by_id` function to get the object by name and id.

- Bug Fixes:
  - Fix error in documentation and function comments.
